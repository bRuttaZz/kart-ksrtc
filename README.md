## Installation

## Development



## To Dos

- Using appropriate version controller, like subversion (I know Git is not a perfect
place to version control binary files. Anywho I'm soo lazy to learn SVN or other mangers rn (feel free to contribute)
- Add animations for (vitory, failure, waiting, etc)
- Package and push to STK Addons. :)
- Make it pretty, and more cartoonish (I've tried my best with the limitted artistic abilities of mine)
- Make it trade mark independent ( If possible )
- Adding shadows and other properties.
- What ever improvements make the mod better
